# Diabetes-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using patient data. This project involves data preprocessing, one-hot encoding for categorical features, and model training using classification algorithms. Ideal for exploring healthcare data analysis and binary classification tasks.

So I just learned some new preprocessing tricks like One hot encoding and I wanted to apply it to a dataset and build an Ml model so I decided to apply my learnings on this data set : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset
And here it is my final model. I used logistic regression as the classification algorithm. You can use whatever suits you best...I mean whichever algorithm increases the accuracy.So good luck!
